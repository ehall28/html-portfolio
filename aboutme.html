                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi there!</p>
                <p>My name is Elise Hall, I am 26 and currently studying a Diploma of Information Technology at Coder Academy. I grew up in a small country town in Victoria and after my schooling years I moved to Geelong to pursue my passion for conservation, and studied a Bachelor of Zoology and Animal Science.</p>
                <p>In my early days, while I was still studying, I landed a job at JB Hi-Fi. During this time, I also worked at various wildlife parks and zoos around Victoria to gain experience in my studied field. I also had the amazing opportunity to study/volunteer in Thailand, where I helped with coral restoration and marine conservation. I also started volunteering at a conservation park called Mt Rothwell Biodiversity Interpretation Centre, where they bred endangered native species all within an enclosed fence. There I ended up landing a job as an Information Officer, in charge of animal wellbeing and conducting night tours for the public. Unfortunately, I did have to give up this position after being promoted to a manager at JB.</p>
                <p>But after 6 long years at JB, I decided that it was time for a change. I have always had a passion and knowledge for technology, but never pursued the career, I always thought you needed to be good at math and equations. But after hearing about how great Coder Academy was from my partner, I thought, why not?</p>
