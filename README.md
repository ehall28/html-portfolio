## Purpose 
The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills as an aspiring web developer and promote myself with the use of a resume and projects. 

## Features
The overall layout of the portfolio is designed to be simple and eye catching, but easy to navigate, all while capturing a glimpse of my personality through bright colour choices.
- Homepage: Contains a central image of myself, allows the user to put a face to the name.
- About me: A small blurb about myself and my achievements, with a small slideshow of images at the bottom; showcasing some of my experiences.
- Projects: Uses a carousel style slider layout for any future employers to flip through my projects with ease.
- Contact: Utilises a submit form for ease of contact, while also showing emphasis to 'follow me' and my work on various social links.
